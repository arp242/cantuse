cantuse is like caniuse.com, except that it lists the browsers in which a
feature *won't* work, instead of listing in which it will. I find this a more
useful way to look at the data.

Right now this is just a basic commandline utility. A web version will be added
*soonâ„¢*.

Install it with `go get arp242.net/cantuse`, which will put the binary in
`~/go/bin`.

It uses the same data as caniuse.com (https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse); you'll
need to fetch the `data.json` yourself:

    curl https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/blob/master/data.json > data.json

Notes:

- Browsers with a usage lower than 0.05% are not displayed individually to
  reduce noise (chances are you don't care about 0.009% of people reported as
  using IE5.5, or 0.004% usage of Firefox 2). It's still counted in the total
  supported number though.

- Partial support is counted as "supported"; see caniuse.com for more detailed
  support notes.

- Use `-untracked` to consider "untracked" browsers as supported. See the bottom
  of this page for a list of untracked browsers: https://caniuse.com/usage-table

- Use `-ignore` to ignore some browsers and always consider them "supported";
  this accepts a comma-separated list of the browser + version as it appears in
  the output; for example:

      $ cantuse -ignore 'IE 11'
      $ cantuse -ignore 'IE 11,Opera Mini all'
